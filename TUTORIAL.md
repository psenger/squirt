## Usage - `squirt-server.js` ðŸª“

The Server, is the receiver of the files, and is the one that will be listening on a port for incoming connections.

```bash
npm install -g @psenger/squirt-cli
squirt-server
Enter the hostname (192.168.0.105):
Enter the http Port (3000):
Enter a Passphrase: Mr MonkeyGo Boom Boom when he EATS yellow Bannanaananans
Enter a Salt: Salted Peanuts taste good, but are not good for you!
Enter a Directory: /tmp/download/
Server listening on port http://192.168.0.105:3000/
